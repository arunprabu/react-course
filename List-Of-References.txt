Day1:
=========
NodeJS 
ES6
react - set up dev environment
1. Create react project.
2. Project folder walk through
3. Understanding components
4. React (helps build the code ) vs ReactDOM (helps render in browser)
4. Understanding JSX
5. components React
6. Props
7. Children Property
8. Understanding State

Day 2:
========
9. Events
    List of Events in React Docs: https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html#supported-events
    Passing Arguments to Event Handlers https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html (last section)
10. Mutating State through setState with event handler
11. React Documentation walk through
12. Componenents Deep dive
    a) Functional components (Stateless)
    b) Class Components (stateful)
12.1. Communication from parent to child and child to parent
    Add to Watchlist example
13. Two Way Binding
14. Adding Styles in css files and importing them in js files
    hint:  import './App.css'; 
    Inline Styles
    hint: inside render method, before return, create 
        var btnStyles = { 
            backgroundColor: 'blue', 
            color: '#ccc'
        }
    <button style={btnStyles} 
15. Conditionals and Lists
    Conditionals work with ternary expression
    example: this.state.foodCount > 0 ? 
                <div>found</div> 
                : 
                <div>not found</div>
    Lists: looping with map
    Key is important when rendering lists with maps

16. How to update state immutably (2 ways)
    a) get a copy of the state propert (example an array)
        const pgms = this.state.programs.slice();    // slice() will give one copy of state property
        //the we can update or delete the value in pgms
        this.setState({programs: pgms}) // then at last use setState to update the original state object
    b) use es6 
        const pgms = [...this.state.programs];
        //the we can update or delete the value in pgms
        this.setState({programs: pgms}) // then at last use setState to update the original state object
17. Debugging
    USing Browser Console.
    Install React Developer Tools
18. Fragments (16.2 feature)
19. Better Project Structure
20. Splitting an App into multiple components - thinking in React
21. Component Lifecycle
    Component Creation Lifecycle in Action
    https://medium.com/@baphemot/understanding-reactjs-component-life-cycle-823a640b3e8d
22. Planning the App
23. How to Include Bootstrap in React App 
    npm i bootstrap --save 
    then,
    in index.js 
    import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'
    That's all!
24. Material UI
      

Day 3:
========
1. Material UI - my-app showcase (1 Hour)
2. Styling Componenents ( 2 Hours )
    Using Sass ( Teach Sass )
    https://medium.com/front-end-hacking/how-to-add-sass-or-scss-to-create-react-app-c303dae4b5bc
    Complete the Project 
    Deploy the App
    ====================

3. Create New App
4. Create the Layout for Crud App
5. Implement Router

    http://manojsinghnegi.com/blog/2017/09/03/Implementing-redux-and-react-router-v4-in-your-react-app/
6. Redux Forms 
    https://alligator.io/redux/redux-form/
7. Using References
    and Ref API
8. Redux 
    Redux is a state management library that gives you access to the state anywhere in your components without the need to pass props.
    'npm install --save redux react-redux'
    'redux package'  is a separate framework, developed by open source community
    'react-redux' is the official library that connects the two.
