What's Redux?
==========
Redux is a state management library that gives you access to the state anywhere in your components without the need to pass props.

Redux is something called the store. It’s where the entire state of your application will live. This is the first main benefit of using Redux. Instead of having to manage the state in different components we have to only manage it in one single place called the store. 

We'll central store that any component can access. So, we don’t have to pass down data from the parent component to deeply nested child components through props. 

So anytime a component needs data it can ask the store and the store will provide it with the data.
