Definitions
=============
Components
  Stateless or Functional components 
  Steteful or Class Components

Props: 
  Core concept of React
  Props are read-only.
  props  allow you to pass data from a parent (wrapping) component to a child (embedded) component.
  changes in props (and also states) will trigger re-render of the Component
  So, DOM will be updated

Children:
  in Parent component JSX,
    <Program>    here goes the children  </Program>
  in child/embedded component, Program.js you can use { props.children } to receive data
States:
  states are objects, that can be passed to a component/diplayed in the same component.
  are available only in Class Components - because it requires 'Component' to be imported in the file.
  not available in Functional Components 
  you should not have states in many places in the app. then it will result in some unpredictable behavior in the app
  state is a reserved word.
  changes in states will trigger re-render of the Component

Cross Component Interaction
  The above 3 are helping us achieve cross component interaction in Angular 

Events
  React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
  onClick={this.setReminder}
