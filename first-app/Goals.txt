Day 2:
========
React - 8 Hours 
13. Two Way Binding
  14. Adding Styles in css files and importing them in js files
        hint:  import './App.css'; 
      Inline Styles
        hint: inside render method, before return, create 
            var btnStyles = { 
              backgroundColor: 'blue', 
              color: '#ccc'
            }
        <button style={btnStyles} 
  15. Conditionals and Lists
      Conditionals work with ternary expression
        example: this.state.foodCount > 0 ? 
                    <div>found</div> 
                    : 
                    <div>not found</div>
      Lists: looping with map
        refer examples

      Key is important when rendering lists with maps
        
  16. How to update state immutably (2 ways)
        a) get a copy of the state propert (example an array)
            const pgms = this.state.programs.slice();    // slice() will give one copy of state property
            //the we can update or delete the value in pgms
            this.setState({programs: pgms}) // then at last use setState to update the original state object
        b) use es6 
            const pgms = [...this.state.programs];
            //the we can update or delete the value in pgms
            this.setState({programs: pgms}) // then at last use setState to update the original state object
